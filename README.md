 # About AnswerChain
AnswerChain provides an offline, passwordless recovery system that empowers individuals and organizations to restore secrets securely. By allowing users to create their own knowledge-based questions and answer options, secrets can be rebuilt without relying on passwords—protected by modern cryptography to ensure safety and trust.





 # Disclaimer

Is this program secure to use?  
- This program was developed with extensive AI assistance. While care has been taken to ensure safety, NO SOFTWARE CAN BE GUARANTEED 100% SECURE. At this stage, I would ***NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS PROGRAM FOR IT's INTENDED PURPOSE UNTIL IT HAS MATURED ENOUGH*** (e.g., gained broader community recognition, reviews, and testing).

Have you had prior experience with coding?
- No, I have not. This is my first application!

## How does it work❓

1️⃣. **User defines their own questions**  
You create your own security questions (e.g., *“What was my first pet’s name?”*)  
and provide multiple answer alternatives.  

---

2️⃣. **Standard and Critical questions**  
When setting up your recovery kit, each question can be marked as:  
- **Standard** → regular knowledge prompts (e.g., *“What city were you born in?”*).  
  These contribute shares toward the recovery threshold and allow flexibility.  
- **Critical** → high-value prompts (e.g., *“What is the code phrase I only told my family?”*).  
  These must **always** be answered correctly for secret restoration to be possible —  
  even if all standard questions are answered correctly.  

This two-tier system combines **usability** (standard questions)  
with **mandatory checkpoints** (critical questions) for maximum security.  

---

3️⃣. **Every alternative is cryptographically protected**  
Each alternative is combined with a random salt and processed through **Argon2id** (a memory-hard key derivation function).  
The derived key is used to encrypt a **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)** share with **cascade encryption**:  
- First layer: **AES-256-GCM**  
- Second layer: **ChaCha20-Poly1305**  

This dual-layer (**cascade AEAD**) ensures ciphertexts all have the same structure  
and strengthens security against single-algorithm weaknesses that the future could present.  

---

4️⃣. **Wrong answers look valid too**  
Incorrect answers are not left empty. Instead, they carry **dummy SSS shares**,  
also Argon2id-hardened and cascade-encrypted (AES-256-GCM + ChaCha20-Poly1305).  

This makes every answer **indistinguishable**, so attackers cannot know which ones are correct.  

---

5️⃣. **Decoy “real” answers**  
Users can define **decoy real answers** that decrypt into plausible but fake secrets.  
Even if an attacker manages to decrypt shares, they cannot tell  
whether the reconstructed output is the genuine secret or a decoy.  

---

6️⃣. **Secret recovery**  
During recovery, you answer your own questions. Each chosen alternative is re-processed  
with **Argon2id** and **cascade decryption**.  

- If the correct set of **Standard questions** is answered,  
  enough valid **SSS shares** may be obtained.  
- But recovery will only succeed if **all required Critical questions** are also answered correctly.  

If both conditions are met, the valid shares can be recombined to reconstruct the secret.  

---

7️⃣. **Final authentication**  
The reconstructed secret undergoes a final **Argon2id + HMAC check**.  
Only if this verification succeeds is the secret accepted as authentic.  


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


# 🔒 Why the Security Questions File (kit) is Secure  

---

## 1. Key Derivation  
Every answer is combined with a random salt and processed through **Argon2id**  
with enforced high memory cost (≥1 GiB, parallelism pinned to 1).  
This makes brute-force attacks prohibitively expensive,  
even for attackers using modern GPUs or ASICs.  

---

## 2. Cascade Encryption  
Each derived key is used in **cascade encryption**, first with **AES-256-GCM**  
and then with **ChaCha20-Poly1305**.  
This guarantees ciphertexts are uniform in structure and provides long-term resilience:  
even if one cipher is broken in the future, the other still protects the data.  

---

## 3. Secret Splitting (SSS)  
The protected secret is never stored directly but split into shares using  
**Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS)**.  
A defined threshold of correct answers must be provided to recombine the secret,  
while any subset below the threshold reveals absolutely nothing.  

---

## 4. Standard vs. Critical Questions  
Questions can be **standard** or **critical**.  
- Standard questions → contribute shares toward the threshold.  
- Critical questions → must always be answered correctly.  

Secret restoration is **impossible** if even one critical question is wrong,  
regardless of how many standard answers are correct.  

---

## 5. Wrong Answers and Decoys  
Wrong answers are indistinguishable from correct ones because they also decrypt into  
**dummy shares** hardened with Argon2id and cascade AEAD.  

Users can also configure **decoy real answers**, which produce plausible but fake secrets.  
These protections ensure attackers can never know whether a recovered result is genuine or a decoy.  

---

## 6. Final Verification  
Once enough shares are collected, the reconstructed secret must pass a  
**final Argon2id + HMAC verification step**.  
This prevents tampering and guarantees that only the genuine secret is accepted.  

---

## 7. Offline and Passwordless  
The entire system is **offline and passwordless**, eliminating risks associated with  
servers, cloud storage, or a single vulnerable master password.  
Everything needed for recovery is self-contained.  

---

## 8. Leak Resilience  
The system is deliberately designed to remain secure **even if the complete file,  
all ciphertexts, salts, and parameters leak online**.  

Attackers gain no useful advantage because:  
- Argon2id makes brute-force infeasible.  
- Cascade AEAD ensures dual-layer protection.  
- Dummy shares and decoys make answers indistinguishable.  
- Shamir’s Secret Sharing prevents partial leakage.  
- Critical questions block recovery without mandatory checkpoints.  
- The HMAC gate validates authenticity.  

---

## 9. Brute-Force Cost Analysis  
After setup, the program presents a **brute-force cost analysis**,  
showing the estimated difficulty of cracking the configuration with modern hardware.  

Users can then adjust Argon2id parameters, thresholds, or question sets  
if they want even stronger security.  

## 10. Uses trusted Cryptographic libraries and implementations

🔒 Cryptography Library Audits

---

## [Shamir Secret Sharing (privy-io)](https://github.com/privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing)
- **Software audit:** ✅ Yes (audited twice)  
- **Algorithm audit:** ✅ Yes

---

## 11. The code

The program is deliberately lightweight, with a minimal codebase—meaning there’s less surface area for potential vulnerabilities and easier maintainability. In practice, **less code often translates into safer code**.  

It adheres to the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/stable-en/02-checklist/05-checklist) and incorporates additional industry-recognized best practices to ensure robust, secure, and reliable implementation.  



---

## 12. Potential leak

During use, the program operates in an inherently sensitive state.
At rest, however, the kit remains secure—even in the event of a total data leak, the true secret cannot be derived without the exact knowledge-based answers. In fact, the entire system is designed around this very principle of security.

# Threat-model–driven inspiration


1️⃣ Public knowledge (online, open to everyone)  
– Examples: facts available on the internet, public records, common trivia.  

2️⃣ Public but restricted knowledge (online, limited to you + authorities)  
– Examples: government records, official registrations, tax or license info.  

3️⃣ Semi-public online identity knowledge  
– Examples: your usernames, personal websites, or activity on forums/social media.  

4️⃣ Shared offline knowledge  
– Information known by you, your family, or close friends (e.g., family traditions, shared experiences).  

5️⃣ Private offline knowledge  
– Information known only by you and a very small circle of trusted parties.  

6️⃣ Exclusive personal knowledge  
– Something that only you know, with no online or offline exposure.

# Use Cases


Simplified password restoration (no IT)  
Employees regain access by answering their own questions — **offline, passwordless**, no helpdesk queue.  

Memory support (amnesia / cognitive decline)  
Familiar, self-authored prompts help recover vaults without needing to recall a master password.  

Crypto seed protection  
Store/recover seed phrases

Family emergency access  
Split recovery among relatives (e.g., **2-of-3**) so one trusted person alone can’t unlock, but together they can.  

Protecting your password manager’s master password

# Example of a feature that could be added (I need your help)!

<details>
  <summary># 🔒 Privacy Protection via Tolerance-Based Authentication for the security questions</summary>

### Example Feature Idea
**Privacy protection of security questions using tolerance-based authentication.**

- All masked answers combine into a single unlock key → hiding both personal data *and* the questions.  
- With **tolerance-based authentication**, small typos are accepted (e.g., `bakke` → `backe`, `bakie`), balancing **usability and security**.  
- Redundancy across multiple questions provides **resilience and accessibility**.

- **Include the AnswerChain program**:  
  - Prepare a **secondary USB** (or use the same boot USB if space allows).  
  - Store a **copy of the AnswerChain executable** on it for redundancy.  
  - This ensures you can always access the program even if one USB fails.  

- **Disconnect from the internet** (Wi-Fi and/or Ethernet) to operate in an **air-gapped environment**.  
- Unplug all **unnecessary USB devices and peripherals**.  
- In short: **reduce the attack surface** before working with security questions and encryption.

  **Hardware precautions**
  - **Use a dedicated offline machine**: Ideally an old laptop/PC used only for this task.  
  - **Remove/disable wireless interfaces**: Physically remove Wi-Fi/Bluetooth cards or disable them in BIOS/UEFI.  
  - **Use write-protected media**: Prefer a USB drive with a **physical write-protect switch** for storing the final kit.

  **OS & media integrity**
  - **Verify ISO integrity** before flashing:  
    ```bash
    sha256sum your-distro.iso            # Compare to vendor's checksum
    gpg --verify your-distro.iso.sig     # When a signature is provided
    ```
  - **Minimal install**: Avoid unnecessary packages; fewer binaries = fewer attack surfaces.  
  - **Use read-only media** when possible: Boot from CD/DVD or a read-only USB image.  
  - **Run entirely in RAM (RECOMMENDED)**: Many live distros support a *copy to RAM* option (e.g., `toram`, `copy2ram`). Choose this at boot if available. **Always run in RAM when you can.**

  **Operational security (OpSec)**
  - **No external storage**: Keep only the required USB connected while working.  
  - **Multiple backups**: After encryption, keep **encrypted** backups in **separate physical locations**.  
    - Online storage is acceptable **only for the encrypted artifact** (e.g., `.gpg`, `.age`, `.7z` with strong passphrase).  
    - Prefer multiple brand-name USB devices you trust (malware-free).  
  - **No logs left behind**: Clear history and temp files at the end of each session:  
    ```bash
    # Bash
    unset HISTFILE; history -c; rm -f ~/.bash_history; sync
    # Zsh
    unset HISTFILE; : > ~/.zsh_history; sync
    ```
    *(Use OS-appropriate methods; commands vary by shell/distro.)*

## 2. Run and Configure the Application
- Boot the live system (prefer **copy to RAM** / **toram**) and **launch the application**.  
- Configure it to your requirements.  
- Store the **security kit** (security questions + all encryption details) on your **write-protected USB**.  
- Ensure a **secondary USB** contains the **AnswerChain program** in case of failure or reinstallation needs.  
- Keep **only the required USB** attached while working.  

---

## 3. Verify Your Setup
- **Version parity**: Use the **same software version** for decryption that you used for encryption to avoid compatibility issues.  
- **Cold-boot test**: Power off, boot again, and ensure you can decrypt.  
- **Cross-device test**: Try decrypting on multiple machines (different hardware).  
- **Media independence**: Boot into the **same** live CD/USB and test; then boot into a **different** live CD/USB and test again.  
- Confirm the decryption process works **exactly as intended** across scenarios. Proceed only when you are confident in **consistency and reliability**.
